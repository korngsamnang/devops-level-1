## What is Linux?
- **Definition**: Linux is an open-source operating system based on the Unix architecture. It is widely used in servers, desktops, and embedded systems.
- **Features**: Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility. It allows users to control the system at a granular level and supports a wide range of applications.

## Origin of Linux
- **Background**: Linux was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It began as a personal project to create a free and open-source alternative to the Unix operating system. Linus Torvalds, a Finnish software engineer, started working on the Linux kernel as a student at the University of Helsinki.
- **Initial Release**: The first version of Linux (0.01) was released in September 1991. It was a minimal kernel with basic features and limited hardware support.
- **Community Contribution**: Linux quickly gained traction within the open-source community, with many developers contributing to its growth and development. This collaborative approach led to rapid improvements and the expansion of Linuxâ€™s capabilities.
- **Growth**: Over the years, Linux has evolved into a powerful and versatile operating system used in a wide range of environments, from servers and desktops to mobile devices and embedded systems.

## Linux Distributions
- **Definition**: A Linux distribution (or distro) is a version of the Linux operating system that includes the Linux kernel and a selection of software packages tailored for specific use cases or user preferences.
- **Examples**: Some popular distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and CentOS. Each distribution may differ in its default software, package management system, and target audience.

## Linux File System

- **`/` (Root Directory)**: The top-level directory that contains all other directories.
- **`/bin`**: Contains essential command binaries (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`).
- **`/etc`**: Contains system configuration files.
- **`/home`**: Contains user directories. Each user has a subdirectory here (e.g., `/home/username`).
- **`/var`**: Contains variable data files like logs and spool files.
- **`/tmp`**: Contains temporary files created by applications.
- **`/usr`**: Contains user-related programs and data, including application binaries and libraries.

## Linux Kernel
- **Definition**: The kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It manages hardware resources, system calls, and facilitates communication between hardware and software.
- **Role**: The kernel handles tasks such as process management, memory management, and device drivers. It provides a bridge between applications and the physical hardware.


## Linux Commands
- **Purpose**: Commands are used to interact with the Linux system. They can perform a wide range of tasks, from file manipulation to system monitoring.
- **Examples**:
    - **`ls`**: Lists directory contents.
    - **`cd`**: Changes the current directory.
    - **`cp`**: Copies files and directories.
    - **`rm`**: Removes files or directories.
    - **`ps`**: Displays information about running processes.


## What is Bash Script?
- **Definition**: Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a command-line interpreter and scripting language for Unix-like operating systems. A Bash script is a file containing a series of commands written in the Bash language.
- **Purpose**: Bash scripts automate repetitive tasks, such as file manipulation, program execution, and system administration. They allow users to create complex workflows and manage system operations efficiently.
- Basic Example:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Hello, World!"
    ```
    - **`#!/bin/bash`**: Shebang line indicating the script should be run using Bash.
    - **`echo "Hello, World!"`**: A command that prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal.
