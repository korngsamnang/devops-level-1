### 1. What is Docker? WHY?
Docker is a platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight containers. Containers ensure consistency across different environments, making applications easy to build, ship, and run.

### 2. What is the advantage of Docker over hypervisors?
Docker uses containerization, which shares the host OS kernel, making it more lightweight and faster compared to hypervisors, which require separate OS instances.

### 3. What is Docker image?
A Docker image is a lightweight, immutable file that contains everything needed to run an application, including code, runtime, libraries, and configurations.

### 4. What is Docker container?
A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. It is isolated, portable, and efficient, providing a consistent environment for the application.


### 5. What is Docker Hub?
Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry where users can find, share, and store Docker images. It acts as a central repository for pre-built images.

### 6. What is Docker Swarm?
Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration tool for Docker. It manages and scales containers across a cluster of machines.

### 7. What is Docker Compose?
Docker Compose is a tool used to define and manage multi-container applications using a YAML file, simplifying the setup and deployment of complex systems.

### 8. What is Dockerfile used for?
A Dockerfile is a script with instructions to build a Docker image. It automates the process of creating images with the required configurations and dependencies.
